Concepts Covered:
basic programming syntax
setup vs. loop vs. custom function
digital vs. analog signals
making a program dynamic
using digitalWrite()
printing to the serial monitor
connecting a board to the current sketch
using a bread board

Project:
write a method outside of setup and loop
light up an LED

Take home:
What is a serial monitor? What does the number in Serial.begin() mean (Hint: what is a baud rate)?
How would you control 3 LEDs instead of 1?
How would you control an analog component, i.e. potentiometer?
What kind of signal is a PWM and how does it work?
